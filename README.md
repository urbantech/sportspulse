## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sportspulse.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sportspulse
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. Update the configuration file to point to your MongoDB instance.

Create a `config` folder in the `src` directory and add a `db.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/sportspulse', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    console.log('MongoDB connected...');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### Test Structure

- `src/tests/simple.test.js`: Sample test to ensure Jest is set up correctly.
- `src/tests/functionModel.test.js`: Tests for the Function model.
- `src/tests/functionRoutes.test.js`: Tests for the Function routes.
- `src/tests/functionUpdate.test.js`: Tests for updating functions.

### Logging

We've included extensive logging in our tests to facilitate debugging. Logs include:

- Database connection status
- Steps in the test lifecycle (`BeforeAll` and `AfterAll` hooks)
- Responses from API calls

Logs can be reviewed in the console output when running tests.
